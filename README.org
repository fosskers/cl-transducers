* Transducers 

This is an implementation of SRFI-171 (Transducers) in Common Lisp. Originally
inspired by Clojure and adapted to Scheme, Transducers are an excellent way to
think about - and efficiently operate on - collections or streams of data. In
the simplest case the data source could be a List, but files can also be treated
so and have their contents operated over using all the usual functions like =map=,
=filter=, =fold=, and others.

Transducers make dealing with data an efficient joy!
