# Transducers

### Unreleased

#### Fixed

- A forgotten `all?` export.

### 1.4.0 (2025-02-15)

#### Added

- `unique-by` for more control over how uniqueness is determined.
- `for` as a better pattern for doing something effectful over the stream.
- `any?`, `all?`, and `reduced?` as modern aliases.

#### Deprecated

- `for-each`: use `for` instead.

### 1.3.1 (2025-01-13)

#### Added

- `reduced` as a better wrapper than calling the constructor `make-reduced` manually.

#### Fixed

- Purged usage of `uiop` which was causing problems downstream.
- `once` handles a `nil` argument better.
- Apply `(optimize (speed 3))` on all `*-reduce` functions.

### 1.3.0 (2024-11-02)

#### Added

- lib: The `median` reducer.
- lib: The `reversed` source to iterate from the end of a vector.

#### Changed

- `concatenate` and `flatten` now support vectors/strings.
- Dropped dependency on `fset` within the main lib.
- Licenses further relaxed to MPL.

### 1.2.0 (2024-07-20)

#### Added

- lib: The `find` reducer now accepts an optional `:default` value for when
  nothing could be found in the transduction that matched the predicate.
- fset: `transduce` implementations for `set`, `map`, `seq`, and `bag`.
- fset: Reducers for `set`, `map`, `seq`, and `bag`.

#### Changed

- lib: Conditions signalled somewhere in the transduction chain can now be
  caught per-item, with various restarts available to rehandle or skip the
  problematic item.
- jzon: plists now `write` as JS objects.

### 1.1.1 (2024-02-08)

#### Fixed

- `allp` and `anyp` now yield `t` in the case of success, and not just "non-nil".

### 1.1.0 (2024-02-02)

#### Added

- New condition: `no-transduce-implementation`

#### Changed

- If `transduce` is called on a type which has no `defmethod` for it, a custom
  condition is thrown with a more helpful error message.
- The JSON support system/package is now named `transducers/jzon` to avoid
  compiler warnings.

### 1.0.1 (2023-12-25)

Merry Christmas! I am jetlagged and writing this at 3:30 in the morning.

#### Fixed

- `for-each` now yields `t` instead of `nil`, since `nil` can interact poorly
  with various control structures.

### 1.0.0 (2023-09-07)

#### Added

- An `uncons` transducer for splitting up a stream of cons cells.
- A `from-csv` transducer to interpret a string stream as CSV data, splitting
  the values into a hash table.
- An `into-csv` transducer that, given some `headers`, reverses the stream of
  hash tables back into strings of CSV.
- A `snoc` reducer for reducing into a list without performing a final reverse.
- A `hash-table` reducer for reducing into a Hash Table. Requires the
  transduction items to be cons cells, with `car` being the key and `cdr` being
  the value.
- A `plist` source for transducing over key-value pairs in a Property List.
- New conditions:
  - `empty-argument`
  - `empty-transduction` (see below)
  - `imbalanced-plist`
  - `non-positive-integer`

#### Changed

- The library is now distributed under the terms of the LGPL to promote wider use.
- Transducing over a `hash-table` now yields the key-value pair as a cons cell,
  instead of just the value. The former behaviour is considered a bug.
- The `seed` argument of the `fold` reducer is now `&optional`. When missing,
  the first value that makes it through the transduction will be used as the
  seed. If the transduction turns out to be empty, then the condition
  `empty-transduction` will be raised.
- The `cons` reducer now uses `nreverse` internally. You better not have been
  saving the intermediate results anywhere!
- `segment`, `window`, and `step` now offer restarts when a bad initial value is
  passed.
- **BREAKING:** `average`, `first`, and `last` no longer accept a fallback
  value. Instead, a condition is raised when the transduction was empty. This
  means that calls that used to look like:

```common-lisp
(t:transduce #'t:pass (t:average 'whatever) '(1 2 3 4 5))
```

should now look like:

```common-lisp
(t:transduce #'t:pass #'t:average '(1 2 3 4 5))
```

Likewise for `first` and `last`.

#### Fixed

- List transduction fixed on Clasp. Clasp doesn't (seem to) support tail-call
  optimization, but it does support `labels`-based TCO. This is also critical
  for the `jzon` support.

#### Deprecated

- `max` and `min` have been deprecated in favour of calling `fold`. The seed
  value for `fold` is optional now, so:

```common-lisp
(t:transduce #'t:pass (t:fold #'max)    '(1 2 3)) ;; => 3
(t:transduce #'t:pass (t:fold #'max 10) '(1 2 3)) ;; => 10
(t:transduce #'t:pass (t:fold #'max 10) '())      ;; => 10
(t:transduce #'t:pass (t:fold #'max)    '())      ;; => Condition!
```

### 0.1.1 (2023-08-11)

#### Added

- A `once` transducer to inject a single value into any point in the
  transduction chain.
- A `for-each` reducer to ignore all results and just consume the stream for its
  side effects.

#### Deprecated

- `all` and `any` should now be called as `allp` and `anyp`. The old names have
  been marked deprecated and you will be warned at compile time.

### 0.1.0 (2023-03-04)

Initial version.
