(defgeneric transduce (xform f source)
  (:documentation "The entry-point for processing some data source via transductions.

This requires three things:

- A transducer function, or a composed chain of them
- A reducing function
- A source

Note: `comp' can be used to chain transducers together.

When ran, `transduce' will pull values from the source, transform them via the
transducers, and reduce into some single value (likely some collection but not
necessarily). `transduce' will only pull as many values from the source as are
actually needed, and does so one at a time. This ensures that large
sources (like files) don't consume too much memory.

# Examples

Assuming that you've required this library with a local nickname of `t', here's
how we can filter an infinite source and reduce into a single sum:

(t:transduce (t:comp (t:filter #'oddp)
                     (t:take 1000)
                     (t:map (lambda (n) (* n n))))
             #'+ (t:ints 1))
;; => 1333333000 (31 bits, #x4F790C08)

Note that due to how transducer and reducer functions are composed internally,
the order provided to `comp' gets applied from top to bottom. In the above
example, this means that `filter' is applied first, and `map' last.

There are a variety of functions to instead reduce into a collection:

(t:transduce (t:map #'1+) #'t:vector '(1 2 3))
;; => #(2 3 4)

Many standard collections can be easily \"sourced\", including those that aren't
normally so conveniently traversed like Hash Tables, Property Lists, and lines
of a file.

;; Read key-value pairs from a plist and recollect into a Hash Table.
(t:transduce #'t:pass #'t:hash-table (t:plist `(:a 1 :b 2 :c 3)))

# Custom Sources

Since `transduce' is generic, you can use `defmethod' to define your own custom
sources. See `sources.lisp' and `entry.lisp' for examples of how to do this.
