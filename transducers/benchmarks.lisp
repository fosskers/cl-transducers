;; OBSERVATIONS
;;
;; SBCL: For only a few sexps, PUSH uses less memory, but STREAM is a bit
;; faster. Adding more sexps actually makes STREAM. use more memory. If the
;; sexps are few but long, STREAM is faster yet, although PUSH is still using
;; the least memory. STREAM the best for the "large file" scenario.
;;
;; ECL: For tiny sexps, PUSH is faster and uses far less memory.
;;
;; Allegro: STREAM is significantly slower and uses several times more memory.
;; PUSH CONVERT a happy medium? But for a file with multiple large function
;; definitions, STREAM is the winner again.
;;
;; CONCLUSION
;;
;; Memory usage depends on how big the sexps are and how many of them there are.
;; Overall, rapidly allocating many streams seems to take more memory. However,
;; for large files of large sexps, the STREAM approach basically always wins.
;; I will go with STREAM because:
;;
;; - For SBCL it performs the best.
;; - It is competitive with other compilers.
;; - It yields a favourable return type without extra conversions.
