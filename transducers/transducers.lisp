  "Transducer: Traverse two transducer paths at the same time, combining the

Given the following transducer chain:

     /4a-5a-6a\\
1-2-3          7-8-9
     \\4b-5b---/

The function F would be applied right before Step 7. In this case, the function
would have to expect the output types of Step 6a and 5b as its arguments.

Note 1: If either branch yields a 'reduced' value, then the entire chain
short-circuits and that is the value applied to the reducer one final time.

Note 2: This function has potentially non-intuitive behaviour with regards to
functions like `filter' that don't always contribute to the final result. The
function F will only be applied (and thus pass values on) if both branches
produced a new value. If either branch 'died' for a particular value, then so
too will the other branch. If this is undesirable, see the higher-order
transducer `tri' for an alternative.
